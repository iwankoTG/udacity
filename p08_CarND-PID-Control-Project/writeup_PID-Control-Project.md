# **PID Control**

## Writeup

The purpose of this project is to enable the vehicle to drive around the lake race track with PID controller. I followd the lesson 12 and implemented the code in C++. With hyperparameters given in the quiz of the Section 11(Kp = 0.2, Kd = 3.0, Ki = 0.004), the vehicle was able to drive without getting off the road around minimum speed. So I tried to tune the hyper parameters to make the car drive faster.

### Rubric Points
Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1972/view). Following criterias were addressed in detail.

### 1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in my implementation.
#### 1.1 Effects of P component
The P component is the component proportional to the cross track error. It has the effect of turning the steering wheel toward the center of the lane when the cte is large. Therefore, if the coefficient of P (Kp) is too small, it slows down the reaction to getting out of the lane. On the other hand, if the Kp is larger, the vehicle oscillate faster as it promptly recovering to the lane center.
I put the following two videos in the writeup folder.
./writeup/1.1_p_00.mp4 Kp = 0
./writeup/1.1_p_09.mp4 Kp = 0.8

#### 1.2 Effects of D component
The D component has the function of preventing overshoot by reducing the effect when the cte becomes small. However, in the lake race trace, the cte may become large because the road is curved. Therefore, if the d component is small, it will not be able to respond quickly to the curve and will run off the road. On the other hand, if the d component is large, it will overreact to the cte generated by the curve, and the direction of the car will change abruptly. As a result, the car will not go out of the lane, but it will be less comfortable to ride.
Below are two videos showing these situations.
./writeup/1.2_d_00.mp4 Kd = 0
./writeup/1.2_d_90.mp4 Kd = 9.0

#### 1.3 Effects of I component
The i component is a component for canceling the systematic bias, and is effective when the angle of the handle is not adjusted to exactly 0. However, when driving on the lake race track, even if Ki was set to 0, no noticeable problem occurred. I think this was because the systematic bias was not set and the impact was difficult to understand because there were few straight roads. On the other hand, increasing Ki caused extra oscillation at the starting point. This was probably due to the overreaction of the car being off center of the lane at the starting point.
I put a following video in the writeup folder.
./writeup/1.3_i_0.02.mp4 Ki = 0.02


### 2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
Next, I tuned the hyperparameters.

### summary
With all of the above implementations, the ego car was able to drive stably for a long period of time while making appropriate lane changes.
