### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of following 5 steps. 
1. convert to grayscale
2. blurred with gaussianfilter
3. detect edges with Canny filter
4. select region with with Mask
5. detect line with Hough transformation

First, I converted input images to grayscale, then I blurred the images with gaussian filter of kernel_size = 5. After that, I detected edges by applying a Canny filter. Parameters of the Canny filter were not elaborated because they worked well. Then, I detected lines by using Hough transform within manually set regions(ROI). 

In order to draw a single line for left and right lanes, I separated ROI in left and right region for each lane. As being able to extract line segments for a single lane, I could get averaged slope and coefficient. Then, a straight line extending to the bottom of the image was generated by using the averaged value.

Followings are the results of applying the above pipelines to test images.

I applyed the same pipeline to videos in test videos folder, and saved the result in test_video_output folder. 

However, optional challenge video generated lots of line segments which were not corresponding to lanes on both sides. Those unwanted setments came from scratched on the roads or bumper in front of the car body. To eliminate those noises, I dropped holizontal line segments by setting threshold for absolute value of slopes.
This process greatly reduced noises for lane detection. 


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be that vertices to set ROI are defined manually. Therefore, if the lanes of both sides are placed outside of the supposed ROI,
the above pipeline would not work properly. 
For example, I needed to set different ROI for challenge video.

Another potential shortcoming would be that the above pipeline does not work for curved road, as I averaged slopes of detected line segments.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to set ROI based on the analysis of input images.

Another possible improvement would be to accumulate detected line segments in the time direction because only lane related results would remain.
